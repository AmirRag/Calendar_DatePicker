How to use:

1. For QlikSense Desktop: put the project into the directory Documents/Qlik/Sense/Extensions
2. For QlikSense Server (QMC): import the project in to the extension.
3. Set two variables, the first one to be used as 'From variable' i.e initial date, and the second variable to be used as 'To Variable' i.e the final date, these variables can be used for calculating time range in your QlikSense app

N.B: the 'To' should be greater than or equal to 'From' variable.
